# Movie_Review_Project
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to predict the IMDb rating/score based on several parameters, including budget, genre, rating, release date, director, and much more. Each year, hundreds of of films are produced worldwide, and some are exceptionally successful and some are surprisingly not. The goal of this project is to predict the success, measured by their IMDb rating, of upcoming films by first analyzing which features contribute heavily to the outcome of the movie, then creating a supervised machine learning model that will predict the IMDb rating. In addition to the supervised machine learning model that we intend to create to predict a movie rating, we are also focusing on several attributes and exploring if there is a corelation between those attributes and the final rating of movies.
The data source for this project was this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies), which is a compiled tabular dataset of the budget, company, country of origin, director, genre, gross revenue, title, rating, release date, runtime, score, number of votes, stars, and writer, which was all scraped from the IMDb website. We hope to accurately predict the success of prospective movies, as well as determine the main contributing factors of a successful film.

## Outline
What affects movie ratings? How can we predict a movie rating? 
In todays world we have so many different ways of watching movies, which also amplifies our choices on what movie to watch. Wether it is in the comfort of our own homes or going to the theater, the decision of what to commit our limited time to is an important one. So how do you narrow down your choices to the movies worth seeing? As a group we will attempt to answer the following questions along with a predictive model for determining movie rating:
* Which studio produces a highest rated movies?
* What genre is the most popular? (the highest rated)
* Does the actor affect the rating of the movie?
* Does the director affect the rating of the movie?

In our project we will present our machine learning model and outcome, describe and show the findings related to the questions above through statistaical analysis and data presentation in Tableau. 

## Summary of Data Preperation
Once we found the data set through [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies)our next step was to prep the data set to ensure it was usable and complete. This was completed through the use of Python and Jupyter Notebook. Through this process we found that the dataset had missing information throughout. The largest portion of the incomplete dataset came from the Budget information for each of the movie titles, there were over 2,000 movies that were missing budget information. Through various conversation and ideas the group decided that this attribute was not entirely necessary for us to be able to answer our main question. Instead of removing the movie titles with the incomplete budget information which would result in removing over 2,000 data points we decided to remove the attribute all together, for all titles. This perserved a lot of the data that we originally started with, and resulted in a ~7,000 title dataset. We did have to delete some titles that had missing data, however those eliminations were very limited and it did not compromise out initial dataset.
