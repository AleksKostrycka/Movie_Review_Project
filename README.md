# Movie_Review_Project
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to predict the IMDb rating/score based on several parameters, including budget, genre, rating, release date, director, and much more. Each year, hundreds of of films are produced worldwide, and some are exceptionally successful and some are surprisingly not. The goal of this project is to predict the success, measured by their IMDb rating, of upcoming films by first analyzing which features contribute heavily to the outcome of the movie, then creating a supervised machine learning model that will predict the IMDb rating.
The data source for this project was [this](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies), which is a compiled tabular dataset of the budget, company, country of origin, director, genre, gross revenue, title, rating, release date, runtime, score, number of votes, stars, and writer, which was all scraped from the IMDb website. We hope to accurately predict the success of prospective movies, as well as determine the main contributing factors of a successful film.
